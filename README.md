# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

This week's challenge I created a portfolio page, I still need to add more applications as the course progresses. 

## What I did

1. I presented with my name, education, work experience
2. Click one of the links in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
3. Click on the link to the section about their work, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
4. Resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


## Problems to be solved
1. Didn't find the solution to vertically aligning sections
2. For <aside> syntax, don't know how to split a page in half, add and modify content in each section separately

## Future work

WHEN click on the images of the applications, viewrs been taken to that deployed application
